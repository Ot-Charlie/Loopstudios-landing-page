## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned
This was my first time working with mobile-first workflow, so I learnt how to prioritze the designs meant for mobile view first then add as you go. 


### Continued development
Media query seems very technical in mobile-first workflow, so I hope to continue developing and get better at it.
